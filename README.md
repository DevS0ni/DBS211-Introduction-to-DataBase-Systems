Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...
```
  * introduce students to data management concepts, database systems and database application programming.
  * learn to represent information with a relational database model and manipulate data with an interactive
    query language.
  * model data using Entity Relationship Diagrams.
  * Describe database concepts and database management systems to non-technical persons.
  * Apply a relational model with constraints to develop a database.
  * Compose a database using a Data Definition Language to solve a simple business problem.
  * Manipulate data using a Data Manipulation Language to maintain and update records in a database.
  * Examine a database to optimise interactions with a simple business application.
  * Apply database privilege and privacy policies to control user access to a database.
  * Execute mathematical operations accurately.
  * Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
  * Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
  * Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
  * Show respect for diverse opinions, values, belief systems, and contributions of others.
  * Interact with others in groups or teams in ways that contribute to effective working relationships and the achievement of goals.
  * Manage the use of time and other resources to complete projects.
  * Take responsibility for one's own actions, decisions, and consequences.
  * Gained a handsome knowledge on all of the topics of Introduction to DataBase Systems namely-

    * Database Management System overview
    * Database advantages and disadvantages
    * Database Models : Hierarchical, Network, Relational,  Object-Oriented

    * File-based (file, record, field) versus Data Model (entity, attribute,
      relationship) versus Relational Model (relation, tuple, attribute)
      versus Relational database (table, row, column)
    * Relational Data Model Basics
    * Relational Algebra Operators: Select, Project, Join
* Database Modeling and Design - 15%
    * Information-Level (Logical) versus Physical-Level Design
    * Identification of User Views
    * Applying high level conceptual models (Entity Relationship Diagram) for Database
      design (entity/relation sets, attribute sets, keys)
    * Low-level or physical Database Design: tables, primary keys, foreign keys
    * Top-down versus Bottom-up Design
* Database  Design Theory and Normalization - 10%
    * Functional Dependence
    * Super Key
    * Primary Key
    * First Normal Form (1NF)
    * Second Normal Form (2NF)
    * Third Normal Form (3NF)
    * Relational Schema
    * Insertion. Deletion, and Modification Data Anomalies
* Structured Query Language(SQL) Overview - 25%
    * Introduction to SQL
    * Create Database tables and views using Data Definition Language
    * Modify database structure using Data Definition Language
    * Add/Update/Delete data using Data Manipulation Language
    * Query data from a database using a SELECT statement
    * Preserve database integrity using constraints NOT NULL, CHECK,
      UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraint
* Physical Database Design - 10%
    * Identify views, security, integrity constraints, and additional constraints:
      uniqueness, mandatory/optional, default value, validation criteria
* Database Management System Features - 10%
    * Maintain data dictionary - 'metadata'
    * Maintain application data
    * Manage integrity constraints for application data
    * Facilitate Database Backup and Recovery

* Database Administrator Responsibilities - 3%
    * Manage end user access to Database
    * Manage shared access to data
    * Granting and revoking privileges
    * Develop and administer database policies
* Database Application Programming - 20%
    * Two-Tire versus Three-Tier architecture in Database Application Development
    * Providing database connection from a business application
    * Accessing and manipulating data in a database from a host language
    * Embedded SQL programming, Dynamic SQL programming, and Cursors
    * Top-down versus Bottom-up Application Design

I declare that all the code & programs in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of Introduction to DataBase System Concepts and it's topic
but must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
